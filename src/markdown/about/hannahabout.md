Hannah began her career over ten years ago at Richmond's famous The Black Sheep. Eager to learn more, and with an interest in wild fermentation, she began learning the craft of naturally leavened bread and pastry at Sub Rosa bakery. She later became the pastry sous chef at the alpine inspired Brenner Pass.

Hannah believes that food should be unpretentious, accessible, and enjoyed as close to the source as possible. Two Fire Table pays homage to the farmer that grow our food, while incorporating our love for the outdoors, making fires, and feeding friends.
