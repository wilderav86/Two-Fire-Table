A Southern Appalachian native, Sarah Rennie began her love of cooking with fire in a wood-fired bakery in Asheville, NC. It was there that she learned the importance of seasonal cooking and supporting local farms.

After working for many great chefs in the area, she moved to Richmond, VA to manage three time James Beard nominated, Sub Rosa Bakery.

Additionally in an effort to enrich her knowledge and skills,Sarah spent time traveling in the American West and in South America to study foods and cultures that surround open fire cooking.

Two Fire Table encapsulates Sarahâ€™s cumulative experiences by emphasizing the fusion of seasonal Virginia ingredients with rich cultures to bring a memorable experience shared by the fire.
